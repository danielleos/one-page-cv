\section{Profile}
      Danielle joined Accenture Technology in September 2017 right after graduating from the University of Warwick with a BSc (Hons) Data Science degree. Most recently she has completed external Java SE8 Training with QA with the aim to complete the official certification within the next few months.
      
      She has experience in building Java applications at university including a virtual robot that navigates through mazes; a social media platform replica called 'Witter'; and a 'battle tank' bot using artificial intelligence theory and the RoboCode API.
      
      Some extra-curricular activities include participating in Google HashCode 2017; learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript \& Python using Codecademy and W3Schools; and producing high-quality documentation across the Software Development Life Cycle. At university she has represented her peers on the Data Science course as a member on the Statistics SSLC panel and was twice elected onto the executive committee for the Taekwon-Do club.
